     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>Hearty and delicious, this easy cabbage and bean soup would be great for a quick meatless meal. Add some cornbread, or a crusty baguette and a green salad, and you're there!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li>2 leeks, white and light green parts only, chopped</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sliced carrots</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 quarts low-sodium vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried Italian herb seasoning</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound cabbage, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>2 (15 ounce) cans great Northern beans</li>
        <li>fresh thyme sprigs for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add leeks and carrots, and cook, stirring frequently, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>Pour in vegetable broth, stir in tomato paste and Italian seasoning, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Using an immersion blender, puree the vegetables and liquid. Season with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Increase heat to medium and bring to a boil. Stir in cabbage, red pepper flakes, and a couple more pinches of salt, if desired. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until cabbage is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
            Stir in beans and simmer until beans are heated through, about 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Serve warm, garnished with fresh thyme sprigs, if desired, and drizzled with olive oil. </li>
